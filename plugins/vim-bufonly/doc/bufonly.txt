                                                *:BufOnly*
:BufOnly[!] [myBuffer]    Unload all buffers except the supplied buffer
                          name/number [myBuffer] (default: current buffer).
                          If the buffer to be unloaded was changed, it will
                          fail, unless when [!] is specified, in which case
                          changes are lost.
